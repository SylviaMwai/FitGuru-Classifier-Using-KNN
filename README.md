# FitGuruðŸ’ªClassifier Using KNN

## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

#### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Personal trainers, gym coaches, and fitness enthusiasts often rely on intuition to categorize workouts as strength or cardio based on how they feel, which is not always consistent or accurate. This becomes even harder when handling data from smartwatches or fitness trackers, especially at scale.

#### ðŸ’¡ Project Objective

This project, FitGuru Classifier, introduces a simple, beginner-friendly machine learning solution using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to automate workout classification. It analyzes key workout metrics such as:

â€¢ Duration

â€¢ Average Heart Rate

â€¢ Calories Burned

â€¢ Time of Day

â€¢ Workout Intensity

The model classifies the workout as either Cardio or Strength with basic but effective logic.

#### ðŸš€ Value Proposition

ðŸ’ªHelps trainers and gyms personalize workout plans with minimal manual effort.

ðŸ’ªEnables fitness apps or wearable tech startups to prototype basic activity labeling.

ðŸ’ªOffers fitness enthusiasts a DIY tool to analyze and understand their training patterns.

This is a foundation-level model that can evolve into a commercial-grade tool by integrating more real-world data, tracking consistency, and offering insights like performance trends or workout recommendations.
